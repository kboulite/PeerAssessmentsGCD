Subject						identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
Activity					Activities 6 possible valuesÂ : WALKING; WALKING_UPSTAIRS; WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS;SITTING; STANDING LAYING;

the others values are  Mean by subject and  by activity for each variable
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
values are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
